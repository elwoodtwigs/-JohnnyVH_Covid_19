    <p>
        Key equipment includes:
    </p>
    <p>
        • Pulse oximeter (provides a simple way to measure pulse and can aid the
        assessment of the deteriorating patient. Hypoxemia may influence prognosis
        of patients with CAP independently of severity scores)
    </p>
    <p>
        • Thermometer
    </p>
    <p>
        • Stethoscope - (auscultation not essential if overall clinical judgement
        [‘gestalt’ or gut-feeling of CAP] is already met. Auscultation should be
        reserved for those where it is crucial to decision making)
    </p>
    <p>
        • Assessing blood pressure significantly increases contact time and should
        be considered only in those in whom it contributes to essential decision
        making to admit or not
    </p>
    <p>
        • We recommend documenting that on examination a ‘limited examination’ was
        performed
    </p>
    <p>
        • Remember: STERILIZE all equipment used between patients.

        Changes to QAH Cardiology referral pathways to support COVID-19
    </p>
    <p>
        To support the department’s sustainability during COVID-19 and to protect
        patients from unnecessary visits to hospital, the Cardiology Department at
        Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust have stopped all face-to-face outpatient
        encounters with the exception of the 2 week heart failure patients.
        Referrals currently being received via eRS are being triaged then patients
        are being contacted to make a treatment plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        To help streamline the process further during this challenging period, the
        department has asked referrers use advice and guidance as the ONLY route of
        referral with immediate effect. Any patients already in the system will be
        dealt with. However going forward, any referrals received that have not
        been through advice and guidance will be not be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
        The department also has a number of patients that were “deferred to
        provider” due to appointments not being available at the time of referral.
        These will be triaged over the coming weeks with one of the following
        outcomes:
    </p>
    <p>
        · If the referral has already been through A&amp;G before being made, the
        consultants will call the patient to discuss their treatment virtually or
        return to GP with advice for further primary care support
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            If the referral has not been through advice and guidance, the referral
            will returned to primary care for the correct advice and guidance
            pathway to be followed
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The above approach does not apply to the heart failure pathway: GPs should
        continue to refer these patients to the Trust in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p>
        We would also like to make you aware that if the consultant feels an echo
        is required following referral for suspected heart failure, this is likely
        to take place in the community by Care UK, who are supporting the Trust
        with diagnostic capacity at this time. There is no change to the referral
        pathway for heart failure, but something you may want to make your patients
        aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
        This revised pathway will enable the department to triage more efficiently
        to ensure urgent cases are identified and will mean a number of patients
        will not need to attend the hospital to see the consultant. This approach
        fits with both the recent guidance around how to manage elective services
        in response to COVID-19, and our ongoing transformation programme which
        aims to reduce face-to-face outpatient appointments in line with the NHS
        Long Term Plan.

        Changes to QAH Dermatology referral pathways to support COVID-19
    </p>
    <p>
        To support the Trust with reducing unnecessary visits to hospital sites for
        patients during this challenging period, the Dermatology Department at
        Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust (based at St Mary’s Hospital) has asked
        referrers to follow the attached revised referral pathway with immediate
        effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        The points to highlight are:
    </p>
    <p>
        · Please only use the 2ww service for anything that needs to be seen within
        the next two weeks i.e. lesions likely to be melanomas, SCCs and other high
        risk skin tumours. Please send referrals via Advice &amp; Guidance with a
        photograph for urgent triage.
    </p>
    <p>
        · PHT are suspending the teledermatology service for the next 3 months. All
        new GP referrals will be triaged via Advice &amp; Guidance with photographs
        submitted by the GP. At point of triage, if the lesion is suspicious or the
        department are unsure about it, they will bring the patient for
        face-to-face consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
        · All routine referrals to be referred to Advice &amp; Guidance with
        photograph attached for triage
    </p>
    <p>
        · Rashes and the management of other skin conditions should also be
        referred via advice and guidance with a photograph attached
    </p>
    <p>
        · Important: Please ensure that the only attachments uploaded are the
        relevant photographs. All other required information must be included
        within the free text box.
    </p>
    <p>
        These revised pathways will enable the department to triage more
        efficiently and the use of photographs with advice and guidance will mean a
        number of patients will not need to attend the hospital to see the

        We have taken the decision to pause diabetic eye screening with immediate
        effect to ensure your patients are not put at unnecessary risk.
    </p>
    <p>
        All appointments have been cancelled and we are currently contacting

        that screening is being paused. We will send a new screening appointment,
        at a later date, when the restrictions are lifted. In the meantime, if any
        of your patients are concerned and showing signs of losing vision, please
        advise them to telephone their local Hospital Eye Service.

            Asymptomatically infected children – infection control implications for
            healthcare professionals in primary care
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr Sanjay Patel - a consultant paediatrician at University Hospital
        Southampton and a specialist in infectious diseases had advised not to
        examine throats in children and I suspect the same would go for adults,
        because of the risk of aerosol generation - please pass this message on to
        all clinicians in your practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following advice has been written by Sanjay for the Royal College of
        Paediatrics and Child Health.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the COVID-19 narrative has focused firmly on adults, there is
        growing concern about the role played by asymptomatic children in the
        spread of infection.
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Transmission from the upper airway has been raised as a particular
        concern by ENT specialists
    </p>
    <p>
        2. With viral replication shown to take place in the upper airway as well
        as the lower airway. This may explain why a number of paediatric and/or ENT
        healthcare professionals have developed disease in the absence of currently
        defined risk factors.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend that the oropharynx of children should only be examined if
        essential. If the throat needs to be examined, personal protective
        equipment (fluid resistant surgical face mask, plastic apron and gloves)
        should be worn, irrespective of whether the child has symptoms consistent
        with COVID-19 or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Suspected tonsillitis in primary care or A+E</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If a diagnosis of tonsillitis is suspected based on clinical history, we
        recommend that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the default stance becomes not
        examining the throat unless absolutely necessary. If using the
        <a href="https://www.mdcalc.com/feverpain-score-strep-pharyngitis">
            feverpain
        </a>
        scoring system to decide if antibiotics are indicated (validated in
        children 3 years and older) 3 , we suggest that a pragmatic approach is
        adopted, although automatically starting with a score of 2 in lieu of an
        examination is not entirely unreasonable. Children with a total
        <a href="https://www.mdcalc.com/feverpain-score-strep-pharyngitis">
            feverpain
        </a>
        score or 4 or 5 should be prescribed antibiotics (we suggest children with
        a score of 3 or less receive
        <a href="https://www.what0-18.nhs.uk/professionals/gp-primary-care-staff/safety-netting-documents-parents/sore-throat-advice-sheet">
            safety netting advice
        </a>
        alone). Although this is likely to result in a temporary increase in
        antibiotic prescribing in children, we feel that this is preferable to
        healthcare staff being unnecessary exposed to COVID-19. Antibiotics rarely
        confer a benefit in children less than 3 years with tonsillitis and should
        only be prescribed in exceptional circumstances or if a diagnosis of
        scarlet fever is strongly considered.

        <u>Letter from QA ENT</u>
        :
    </p>
    <p>
        Dear Colleagues,
    </p>
    <p>
        We are in the midst of unprecedented times requiring some very difficult
        and different working practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would like to ask for your help on behalf of my department regarding 2
        Week Wait referrals into ENT.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are all trying to limit attendances for patients as much as possible. It
        has emerged in the last few days specifically that ENT examinations and
        nasendoscopy confer a particularly high chance of spreading COVID to the
        clinician with very high associated viral loads. So far in the UK one ENT
        surgeon has died and a number are currently ventilated. This has been
        confirmed with similar demographics in Asia. National guidance from this
        Friday is that ENT Surgeons should be using the full PPE for these
        procedures which is obviously in very limited supply and I fear for the
        safety of our department when this runs out and if we are then forced to
        perform these examinations and emergencies without protection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our current 2 week wait criteria result in only 1.8% of patients found to
        have a cancer. On that basis I would like to make some emergency
        suggestions given the current situation that might help to better risk
        stratify and ensure that only the most essential patients are seen for
        assessment.
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            Patients under 40 are very unlikely to have head and neck cancers. It
            should be exceptional to have to refer these patients
        </li>
        <li>
            The majority of patients traditionally seen in 2 week wait clinics have
            one of the following symptoms:
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        - Persistent Throat clearing
    </p>
    <p>
        - Sensation of Lump / Tickle in the throat
    </p>
    <p>
        - Feeling of swallowing past something (without dysphagia)
    </p>
    <p>
        · This is very unlikely to be cancer, most likely to be related to silent
        reflux and I would suggest consider these options before considering
        referral for further clinical assessment:

        please only refer if you can actually feel a neck lump.

    </div>
    <p>
        To support the department’s sustainability during COVID-19 and to protect
        patients from unnecessary visits to hospital, the Gastroenterology
        Department at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust are continuing to manage
        referrals via the usual grading process but will assess them by phone
        rather than face to face. Every 2ww / urgent case will have a record of
        telephone conversation or action by letter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Gastroenterology team is also following the latest guidance from the
        BSG/JAG (see link at end of message) around which patients should be
        offered endoscopy – this is limited to those with emergency and
        life-critical conditions, such as a GI bleed or those requiring emergency
        ERCP, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        To support the department and ensure patients are kept safe during this
        challenging period we have agreed the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        • Please use advice &amp; guidance as first point of referral. The clinical
        teams will endeavour to give strong advice at that point to negate the need
        for referral where possible
    </p>
    <p>
        • Please give as much information as possible in the A&amp;G request using
        the free text box, rather than attachments such as relevant medical
        history, tests already carried out and the results
    </p>
    <p>
        • Patients who are considered lower risk following clinical triage will be
        directed back to the GPs with a management plan including the clinical
        threshold for consideration of future referral if necessary
    </p>
    <p>
        This revised pathway will enable the department to clinically triage and
        review more efficiently to ensure urgent cases are identified and will mean
        a number of patients will not need to attend the hospital to see the
        consultant. This approach fits with both the recent guidance around how to
        manage elective services in response to COVID-19, and our ongoing
        transformation programme which aims to reduce face to face outpatient
        appointments in line with the NHS Long Term Plan.

        Suspension of Faecal Calprotectin and FOB testing with immediate effect –
        Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust
    </p>
    <p>
        Effective immediately we will be suspending the following faecal tests
        because they require significant manual sample handling. COVID19 can be
        isolated from faecal samples and this is a step we need to take in order to
        protect our staff. Similar actions are being taken by other Biochemistry
        labs in the UK. The tests affected by this are calprotectin and faecal
        occult blood. You will no longer be able to request these tests on ICE and
        any FOB samples that we receive will not be analysed at all. Any
        calprotectin samples we receive may be tested at a later date if this
        becomes possible.

        We hope to review this as the situation develops.

    <p>
        Observations from Dr. Ali Bartens, QAH Geriatrician (6.4.20)
    </p>
    <p>
        · We are seeing increasing number of atypical presentations in older people
    </p>
    <p>
        · Some people are “not quite right” or gone off food or legs including
        falls and then the more typical syndrome develop a few days later
    </p>
    <p>
        · They may well not present with fever and this may develop within 48 hours
    </p>
    <p>
        · Patients can seem relatively asymptomatic but when they deteriorate it
        has been seen to be very rapid with deoxygenation being the dominant issue
    </p>
    <p>
        · We have not seen many inappropriate admissions but the care home
        population are still coming and I think this relates to care home staff
        feeling anxious about the imminent risk to others in the home setting
    </p>
    <p>
        · The number of cases we are seeing in hospital is not growing quite as
        precipitously as we’d anticipated but there is steady growth
    </p>
    <p>
        · The clinical picture is quite fascinating:
    </p>
    <p>
        o May be minimally symptomatic
    </p>
    <p>
        o Then may see fever which can be difficult to control
    </p>
    <p>
        o Breathlessness is disproportionate (lower RR) than you’d expect for
        degree of desaturation
    </p>
    <p>
        o Lymphopenia and raised CRP seem pretty universal
    </p>
    <p>
        o Reduced taste and smell seem to be early feature as well
    </p>
    <p>
        o CXR uniformly demonstrates peripheral infiltrates and alveolar patchy
        shadowing
    </p>
    <p>
        o Loss of energy and risk of deconditioning fairly uniform
    </p>
    <p>
        · Some people are bouncing back quite quickly even though odds stacked
        against them, in terms of comorbidities
    </p>
    <p>
        · No two people seem to behave the same and there’s no real way of knowing
        by eye-balling them
    </p>
    <p>
        · The sensitivity if swabbing remains 70-80% and we are seeing people whom
        fulfil case definition without alternative cause, but with negative swab
        results
    </p>
    <p>
        · We are successfully discharging people
    </p>
    <p>
        · There continues to be anxiety in care-giving groups and care homes about
        sending back people recovering from COVID, which is understandable

        but one operating successfully elsewhere and I am excited to be involved. I
        have remote clinics Monday, Wednesday and Friday when I will be happy to
        work with adult patients (aged 16 or over) with non-pathological MSK
        complaints. In this role I am able to assist with self-help advice,
        information, reassurance, support with reactivation, exercise provision and
        advice on further referral/care.
    </p>
    <p>
        In an earlier message introducing this service it was suggested that the
        initial management strategies for a MSK/ST injury are utilising the basics
        of Protect, Rest, Ice, Compress, Elevate and Short course of topical/oral
        NSAIDs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would add that guidelines for spinal pain differ in that once red flags
        are excluded the emphasis should be on reassurance and
        reactivation/activity as this results in faster recovery, reduces
        likelihood of chronicity and gives patients a better strategy for managing
        future episodes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not assume patients require or want medication for spinal pain.
        Medication is seen to reduce pain in spinal pain patients but has a small
        effect size compared to placebo suggesting much of its impact is
        non-pharmacological. This should be offered to patients who need it with an
        explanation that its role is to help support a return to / increase
        activity not to make them better.
    </p>

        I am very happy to discuss patients and can be contacted via    <a href="mailto:jonathan.field@nhs.net">jonathan.field@nhs.net</a> or

        Update regarding COAST service
    </p>
    <p>
        In partnership with NHS 111 we have agreed to implement a 6<sup>th</sup>
        HRG around Upper Respiratory Tract Infection/COVID-19 to support parents
        and carers with children who are likely to be displaying symptoms of this
        virus.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will be a telephone, support, advice and guidance service only for
        this condition.
    </p>
    <p>
        This service is now running 7 days a week 10:00 am through to 8:00pm
    </p>
    <p>
        As well as the new service offer above, the COAST service will still
        continue to take referrals from CAU, ED and any GP who is redirected to us
        via the Consultant Advice Line, to provide support and assessment at home
        if appropriate and safe to do so. We are quickly implementing a video link
        service which will assist in remote face to face consultation which we will
        also use as appropriate for this work. Plans are in place to review and
        adapt this on a weekly basis.

        COVID-19 advice for parents of children with any clinical condition known
        to the QAH Paediatric team:
    </p>
    <p>
        · COVID-19 has been shown to be a relatively mild illness in children, even
        those with significant underlying medical conditions
    </p>
    <p>
        · There is no treatment for COVID-19 and children will not be swabbed
        unless they need to be admitted to hospital
    </p>
    <p>
        · Most children will be able to be managed at home with their usual
        treatments. Make sure you are giving all regular treatments (including
        immunosuppression) as reliably as possible to optimise their health
    </p>
    <p>
        · Children should follow government or your specialist team’s guidance
        about this over the next few days/weeks
    </p>
    <p>
        · Fever and respiratory symptoms should be managed in the same way as they
        would have done 6 months ago before COVID-19 was an issue. If worried about
        fever and/or chest symptoms then follow the pathway that you would have
        done previously for these problems

        QAH Urology: We are introducing a new referral form for the 2ww Prostate
        pathway which should make recording your consultation and referral
        information within EMIS Web much easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system is produced for Fareham and Gosport and SE Hampshire CCGs by
        Ardens and consists of a dedicated clinical template with which to gather
        the referral information and a document template. The template entries are
        saved to the record and then the referral form (document template) is
        launched which attaches the consultation content to the form. Both should
        already be installed on your system. Please contact ardens.emis@nhs.net if
        you are unable to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The clinical template is called: “2ww Prostate Referrals F+G and SEH
        (v13.5) (Ardens-QMasters)”.
    </p>
    <p>
        The document template is called: “2WW Suspected Prostate Cancer Referral

        include; check/uncheck
    </p>
    <p>
        the relevant boxes as appropriate, then click ‘OK’

        This approach fits with both the recent guidance around how to manage
        elective services in response to COVID-19, and our ongoing transformation

        From Lucy Clack 22.04.20:
    </p>
    <p>
        The main study are going to be doing is the PRINCIPLE study. This is an
        open-label, randomised study between normal care and Hydroxychloroquine
        sulphate. This study is for patients 50+ with risk factors and all those
        over 65. We have just been given the green light and we now have the meds
        in stock. We will be texting all potentially-suitable patients, telling
        them that if they develop symptoms they can contact the study team
        directly. We will still be dispensing the medication from Liphook. We also
        can obviously recruit opportunistically and if you find a potentially
        suitable patient who is interested just message me and I will sort
        everything else out.
    </p>

            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We also have started two surveillance studies in the surgery this week. One
        is a virology swabbing study which includes all ages (if they are in the
        high risk or over 65 they would obviously prefer they go into PRINCIPLE
        trial but if not one of these we can include them in this one). They have
        to have had their symptoms for &lt; 7 days which might be slightly tricky
        as we are unlikely to have contact with them in this first week, but saying
        that I was able to include our first patient today. We only get paid £5 per
        sample but it helps them build a better picture of the actual spread of the
        virus and as you can imagine patients are keen as we will get the results
        back and find out if they have COVID or not. It can take up to 9 days to
        get results back though!
    </p>
    <p>
        The third study is a serology study that Kathryn started on Monday. This is
        taking an extra vile of blood from those coming into the surgery anyway for
        bloods. They only need to give verbal consent which makes things very
        quick. This is testing for background immunity but as they don’t know the
        effect of this yet they are not giving us or the patient any results.
        Saying that Kathryn said she had a really positive response on Monday and
        from now on Gill and her will be taking these samples from patients in
        their clinics (thank you both). Again we get £5 each for these which isn’t
        a huge amount but I think we will rack up the numbers pretty quickly.

            Denosumab - Denosumab is now available as a pre-filled syringe.
            Patients will still need to see a healthcare professional for their
            next injection, which should not be missed or deferred for more than
            four weeks. However if they are trained in the self-injection

        · Contraception - The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH)
        has written several clinical statements to support effective contraception
        during the COVID-19 outbreak. This guidance includes the recommendation
        that for individuals already established on a combined hormonal
        contraception, it is reasonable to allow a further remote prescription to
        cover up to an additional 6-12 months’ supply, without rechecking BMI or
        blood pressure. For existing progestogen only pill users, it is reasonable
        to allow a further 12 months’ supply, without review. These documents may
        be accessed via:

        information summary dated 3<sup>rd</sup> April 2020:
    </p>
    <p>
        o Sexual Health: All initial consultations in sexual health will be done
        remotely via telephone. Only patients that fulfil the FSRH and BASHH urgent
        guidelines will then be seen via a face to face consultation. The sexual
        health service is providing treatment by post where appropriate to reduce
        face to face consultations.
    </p>
    <p>
        o Oral EHC is still available from most community pharmacies. Pharmacies
        can now provide this service as a telephone consultation and arrangements
        are in place for patient representatives to collect EHC following a
        telephone consultation for women who are self-isolating and unable to
        attend pharmacies in person.
    </p>
    <p>
        o FSRH have released guidance to support provision of effective
        contraception during the COVID-19 outbreak. The guidance provides the
        recommendation that for individuals already established on a contraceptive
        method, it is reasonable to allow further remote prescription to cover up
        to a further 12 month supply of combined hormonal contraception and
        progestogen only pill.

        · Vitamin D supplements - the need to take Vitamin D supplements has
        recently been in the national press and relevant
        <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/">
            guidance
        </a>
        has been updated on the NHS website. It is suggested that all members of
        the public, except those who require high treatment doses, should consider
        purchasing a supplement from a pharmacy, supermarket or online health food
        shop.
    </p>
    <p>
        The guidance is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        o Consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day to keep your bones and
        muscles healthy
    </p>
    <p>
        o This is because you may not be getting enough vitamin D from sunlight if
        you’re indoors most of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
        o There have been some news reports about vitamin D reducing the risk of
        coronavirus. However, there is currently no evidence that this is the case
    </p>
    <p>
        o Do not buy more vitamin D than you need
    </p>

        · Urgent Prescriptions - Due to the constraints on accessing medication,
        patients and pharmacies are utilising various means to ensure patient
        safety whilst allowing individuals to obtain their prescriptions. To enable
        safe prompt delivery of medication, already established pharmacy delivery
        services are working alongside volunteer groups, family members and local
        community care groups. There have been some difficulties in patients
        accessing urgent medication which can lead to increased patient anxiety and
        a strain on pharmacy services and the pharmacist/patient relationship.
        Prescribers should discuss urgent prescriptions with their patients at the
        time of prescribing and think about how the patients are actually going to
        obtain the medication. If it is not reasonably possible to obtain a
        prescription before the end of a working day then a clinical decision needs
        to be made by the prescriber as to whether it can wait until the following
        day and formulate a plan if this is not safe or appropriate. It is
        important not to have unrealistic expectations as to what a
        volunteer/pharmacy delivery service should be able to achieve in a short
        time frame

        · Secondary care requests to prescribe - In order to minimise hospital
        attendances for patients at high risk for Covid-19, there may be some
        occasions when G.P.s are asked to prescribe a medicine that is normally
        supplied through secondary care. For example, a prolonged course of
        antimicrobial for an immunocompromised patient might be requested. Full
        details should be made clear in the request, but please ask a member of
        your Medicines Optimisation Team if you are unsure. NB: This does not apply
        to medicines that are subject to specialised commissioning arrangements

        · Triptorelin - The RCGP Guidance on workload prioritisation during
        COVID-19 lists administration of gonadotrophin releasing hormone injections
        as one of the essential services that must be continued. Decapeptyl 22.5mg
        (triptorelin) is licensed for the treatment of metastatic and
        non-metastatic prostate cancer and is administered once every 6 months. Use
        of this product enables a reduced number of visits to the surgery and it
        should be considered as the first choice agent for patients whose condition
        is stable.

            NHS111 COVID Clinical Advice Service (CCAS) appointments
        </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
        From LMC 20.4.20:
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent amendments to the GMS regulations, will increase the minimum number
        of appointments that practices must make available for 111 direct booking
        and all practices must now make a minimum of 1 appointment per 500 patients
        available for direct booking from NHS 111 through the CCAS clinical triage
        service. The 1 in 500 figure is not in addition to 1 in 3000, it replaces
        it. The previous locally booked NHS111 appointments are now part of this
        overall figure. We're expecting further guidance to be published shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a difference between the current local NHS111 appointments, which
        were used to book in to practice appointment systems for patients that
        don't have COVID-19 related symptoms, and the new national CCAS. This
        service is staffed by clinicians, including returning GPs, and is intended
        to take the pressure off Practices by dealing directly with many of their
        patients with COVID-19 related symptoms. The CCAS service is additional
        capacity to support your Practice, and should reduce the number of patients
        the Practice has to deal with directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Patients with COVID symptoms are asked to initially use NHS111 online, this
        will then provide them with advice or direct them to phone NHS111. The call
        will be triaged and if thought to be a person with potential COVID it will
        be passed to the CCAS. A clinician will triage the patient and broadly
        patients will be divided into three categories:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. Able to stay at home and self-care.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Patient is seriously ill and required hospital care and this is then
        organised.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. The person may require a face-to-face assessment either in the surgery
        or by home visit - these are the ones that are then passed to Practices for
        them to decide the most appropriate course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
        CCAS was commissioned to support Practices and reduce the demand on general
        practice and prevent the system become 'overrun'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Patients should not be told by CCAS that they will be phoned back at a
        particular time, as per the nominal appointment slot they may have been put
        in to.
    </p>
    <p>
        The appointment slots are just a technical way of transferring patients
        from CCAS to the Practice. It is for the Practice to determine how they
        respond to the patients who have been transferred to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Practices may therefore set up a separate triage list that they monitor
        during the day alongside whatever their normal arrangements are for
        managing patients who have contacted the practice directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In most areas the numbers transferred will be far fewer than were
        originally modelled, and which led to the 1 in 500 figure.

        Pausing the NHS complaints process
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the ongoing COVID19 pandemic NHS England and NHS Improvement are
        supporting a system wide “pause” of the NHS complaints process which would
        allow all health care providers in all sectors to concentrate their efforts
        on the front-line duties and responsiveness to COVID19 this means that:
    </p>
    <p>
        · All providers should ensure that patients and the public are still able
        to raise concerns or make a complaint, but that the expectation of an
        investigation and response in the near future is managed.
    </p>
    <p>
        · All providers would continue to acknowledge complaints, log them on their
        respective systems, triage them for any immediate issues of patient safety,
        practitioner performance or safeguarding and take immediate action where
        necessary. All complaints would then remain open until further notice,
        unless an informal resolution could be achieved, or the complainant chooses
        to withdraw their complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
        · In secondary care where PALS offices still operate, they could still
        provide support by email and telephone and this should be encouraged for
        patients and the public to engage with the organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
        · CCGs should ensure that they continue to have open channels of
        communication with patients and the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        · We would advise the system that consideration should be given to
        complainants who, at the time of the “pause”, have already waited
        excessively long for their response (specifically those who have waited six
        months or more) these should be reviewed to ascertain if and how these can
        be resolved to the complainant’s satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        · The initial “pause” period is recommended to be for three months with
        immediate effect. All health care providers can opt to operate as usual
        regarding the management of complaints if they wish to do so and this
        “pause” is not being enforced.
    </p>
    <p>
        · Please note that of 26 March, the Parliamentary and Health Service
        Ombudsman has stopped accepting new NHS complaints and has stopped work on
        open cases.

    <p>
        Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman update on health complaints
    </p>
    <p>
        Dear Forum member
    </p>
    <p>
        As we all know, the coronavirus pandemic is putting unprecedented pressure
        on the National Health Service. This has meant many NHS organisations are
        struggling to answer complaints, and many complaints staff members have
        understandably been redeployed to help with tackling the coronavirus.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having considered our position carefully, we have decided that we should
        not place additional burdens on the health service at this time. We will
        therefore pause our work involving health complaints with effect from
        Thursday 26 March and until further notice. This means that we will not
        accept new health complaints, nor progress existing ones where this
        requires contact with the health service or clinical advisers. We will of
        course keep the situation under close review.
    </p>
    <p>
        We appreciate that this will have an impact on our complainants and
        stakeholders, and will raise a number of questions about what happens in
        the interim. We ask for your patience at this time. Please note that our
        telephone lines will remain open to give advice to callers, although we
        will not be able to deal with new complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find more information about our decision on our website and answers
        to the questions some of you have already raised below.

        Assistant Director of Strategy &amp; Partnerships Parliamentary and Health
        Service Ombudsman
    </p>
    <p>
        Question &amp; Answers for complaints handling teams
    </p>
    <p>
        Q1. What does ‘pausing’ actually mean for ongoing investigations?
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only progress health cases (both assessments and investigations) up
        to the point we need to get clinical advice or contact a health
        organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q2. Will there be any exceptions?
    </p>
    <p>
        We are mindful of our responsibility to support vulnerable people who may
        be distressed by work pausing on their complaint. In these cases, we will
        continue to ensure that appropriate action is taken, where we can as well
        as signposting people to organisations who can provide support.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have such a case your PHSO Caseworker will be in touch to agree how
        to take this forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q3. What should I do if I am contacted by a complainant on a case currently
        being dealt with by PHSO?
    </p>
    <p>
        Please inform the complainant that PHSO has paused its work on new and
        existing NHS complaints that involve contacting the health service and
        direct them to our website where they can find more information. PHSO
        caseworkers will be contacting existing complainants in due course to
        advise them when we are unable to do any further work on their case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q4. We have completed the local complaints process and are still issuing a
        final decision. Should I still refer the complainant to the PHSO?
    </p>
    <p>
        No. Please use the following paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re not happy with how we’ve dealt with your complaint, you are
        entitled to raise your complaint with the Parliamentary and Health Service
        Ombudsman. However, please note that the Ombudsman is currently not
        accepting any new complaints about the National Health Service because of
        the COVID-19 pandemic. This is to help ensure the NHS can focus its
        resources on providing urgent healthcare. You can find out more information
        on the Ombudsman’s website www.ombudsman.org.uk
    </p>
    <p>
        Q5. What should local complaints teams do?
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a very challenging time and each organisation will need to decide
        what is most appropriate in the circumstances for them. You should inform
        complainants of any changes to your complaints handling procedures,
        including if there are delays in responding to complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q6. Will the Ombudsman penalise us for delays caused by the pandemic?
    </p>
    <p>
        No. We will ensure that we take into consideration the impact of the
        pandemic on all decisions you have had to make during this difficult time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q7. How will this affect your consideration of the 12-month time limit for
        bringing complaints to the Ombudsman?
    </p>
    <p>
        If the health complaint is in time as of 26 March 2020, we will continue to
        treat it as in time when we resume consideration of health complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q8. Government departments are also under extreme pressure so why are you
        not pausing these investigations as well?
    </p>
    <p>
        We are mindful of the extreme pressure the NHS is current under in trying
        to tackle COVID-19. The decision to pause health complaints is our way of
        ensuring we do not place additional burdens on stretched NHS resources at
        this time. We are aware of the different pressures that COVID-19 is placing
        on Government Departments and we will continue to monitor the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Q9. When will you resume normal service?
    </p>
    <p>
        We will regularly review the overall position to decide when it would be
        right to re-start our work. That is likely to be at a time when the NHS
        will be able to respond to our enquiries without causing an unnecessary
        burden on the resources being used to respond to the pandemic. When this
        happens, we will let you know and post information about next steps on our
        website.

        LMC statement (10.4.2020): “The NHS 111 Online Get an Isolation Note
        service issues isolation notes to individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 or
        those having to self-isolate due to residing with someone with COVID-19
        symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Employers have received clear guidance that for all COVID-19 related
        illness they should accept the Isolation Note as medical evidence to
        support absence from work and not require employees to get a fit note from
        a GP.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an employer asks for fit notes relating to non COVID-19 health
        conditions for payment of Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Occupational Sick Pay
        (OSP), GPs should complete a fit note in the normal way, scan this and then
        email it to the patient, with due consideration of GDPR and with the
        necessary consent in place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Should an employer insist on a paper copy fit note, this can be posted to
        the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
        GPs can issue fit notes for a clinically appropriate time, which can be up
        to 13 weeks within the first six months of a condition, in line with
        existing guidance”.
